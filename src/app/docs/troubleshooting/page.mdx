# Troubleshooting

## Build Failed

Check the build logs in deployment details. Common causes: missing Dockerfile, syntax errors, missing dependencies.

## Container Exits Immediately

Check container logs in deployment details. Ensure your app listens on the `PORT` environment variable (default 8080).

## Domain Not Working

Verify DNS is pointing to your server's IP. Use [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org) to check propagation.
