# Private Registries

Pull images from private Docker registries.

## Supported Registries

- Docker Hub (private repos)
- GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)
- Custom registries

## Setup

1. Go to **Settings > Registries**
2. Add a registry with your credentials (URL, username, password)
3. When creating an image-type service, select the registry to authenticate pulls

## Usage

Once a registry is configured, select it when creating or updating a service that uses `image` deploy type. Frost will log in to the registry before pulling the image.
