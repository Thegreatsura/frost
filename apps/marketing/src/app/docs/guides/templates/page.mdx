# Templates

Templates provide one-click setup for common services, databases, and multi-service projects.

## Types

**Databases** - PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, and more. Pre-configured with volumes and health checks.

**Services** - Self-hosted apps like MinIO, Grafana, PocketBase. Ready to deploy with sensible defaults.

**Projects** - Multi-service stacks (e.g., app + database). Services are pre-wired to communicate with each other.

## Usage

Select a template when creating a new service or project in the Frost UI.

## Auto-Generated Secrets

Templates can auto-generate secure values for passwords and tokens. Fields like `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` are filled with random secrets on creation.

## Cross-Service References

In project templates, services can reference each other's environment variables. For example, a web app template might reference the database password from the postgres service, so connection strings are configured automatically.
