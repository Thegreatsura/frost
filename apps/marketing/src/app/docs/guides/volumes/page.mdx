# Volumes

Volumes provide persistent storage that survives container restarts and redeploys.

## When to Use

Use volumes for data that must persist across deployments: database files, uploaded content, cache directories.

## Configuration

Add volumes in service settings. Each volume needs:

- **Name** - Identifier for the volume (lowercase, numbers, dots, dashes)
- **Mount Path** - Absolute path inside the container (e.g., `/data`)

## Behavior

- Volumes are created automatically on first deploy
- Data persists across redeploys and container restarts
- Volumes are scoped to a service — not shared between services
- Services with volumes cannot be rolled back (to prevent data corruption)
