# GitHub Integration

Connect Frost to GitHub for automatic deployments and PR previews.

## Setup

1. Go to **Settings > GitHub**
2. Follow the prompts to install the Frost GitHub App on your repositories
3. Once installed, connect individual services to their repos

## Auto-Deploy

When enabled, pushing to a service's configured branch triggers an automatic deployment.

- Toggle per-service in service settings
- Only triggers on the branch the service is configured to deploy from
- Requires the GitHub App to be installed on the repo

## PR Preview Environments

When a pull request is opened against a connected repo, Frost automatically creates a preview environment:

- Services from the production environment are cloned into the preview
- A deployment runs for the service matching the PR's repo
- Frost posts a status comment on the PR with the preview URL and deployment status
- When the PR is closed or merged, the preview environment is automatically destroyed

## Requirements

- GitHub App installed on your organization or account
- Repository connected to a Frost service
- Service must use `repo` deploy type
