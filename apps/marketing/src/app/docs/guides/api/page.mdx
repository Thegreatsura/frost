# API

Frost has a REST API for programmatic access.

## Authentication

Include the `X-Frost-Token` header with your API key:

```bash
curl https://your-frost-server/api/projects \
  -H "X-Frost-Token: your-api-key"
```

## Creating an API Key

Go to **Settings > API Keys** and create a new key. The full key is shown once — save it somewhere safe.

## Example: Deploy a Service

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-frost-server/api/services/SERVICE_ID/deploy \
  -H "X-Frost-Token: your-api-key"
```

## API Reference

Full API documentation is available at `/api/docs` on your Frost instance.
