# Health Checks

Frost health checks verify your container is ready to receive traffic before routing requests to it.

## Modes

**TCP** (default) - Frost checks if the container's port accepts connections.

**HTTP** - Frost makes a `GET` request to a path and expects a 2xx response. Set `health_check.path` to enable.

## Configuration

### frost.yaml

```yaml
health_check:
  path: /health
  timeout: 60
```

### UI

Set **Health Check Path** and **Health Check Timeout** in service settings.

## Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `health_check.path` | HTTP endpoint to check. Omit for TCP mode |
| `health_check.timeout` | Seconds to wait for healthy status (1-300, default 60) |

## Troubleshooting

**Health check fails immediately** - Your app is likely binding to `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`. Containers must bind to `0.0.0.0`.

**Health check times out** - App takes too long to start. Increase `health_check.timeout` or optimize startup time.

**HTTP health check returns non-2xx** - Ensure the path returns a 200-299 status code. Check app logs for errors.

**Works locally but fails on Frost** - Verify the health endpoint works inside the container, not just on the host. Run `docker run` locally and test with `curl`.
