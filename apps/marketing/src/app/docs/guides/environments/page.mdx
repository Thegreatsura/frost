# Environments

Environments let you run isolated copies of your services within a project.

## Types

**Production** - The default environment, created automatically with every project. One per project.

**Preview** - Auto-created when a pull request is opened on a connected GitHub repo. Services are cloned from production. Destroyed when the PR is closed or merged.

**Manual** - User-created environments for staging, testing, or other purposes. Create from the project page. Can optionally clone services from an existing environment.
