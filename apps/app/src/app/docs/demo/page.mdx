# Component Demo

A showcase of all documentation components.

## Typography

Regular paragraph text looks like this. It uses neutral-300 color for readability on dark backgrounds.

**Bold text** is used for emphasis. *Italic text* for subtle emphasis.

## Links

Internal link: [Installation](/docs/installation)

External link: [GitHub](https://github.com/elitan/frost)

Frost is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and uses [Docker](https://docker.com) for containerization. Check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/elitan/frost) for more details.
