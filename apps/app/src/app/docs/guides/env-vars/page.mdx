# Environment Variables

Set environment variables at two levels:

**Project-level** - Inherited by all services in the project.

**Service-level** - Specific to one service. Overrides project variables with the same name.

## Built-in Variables

Frost automatically sets `PORT` (default 8080). Your app should listen on this port.

## Applying Changes

After modifying environment variables, redeploy the service for changes to take effect.
