# Services

A **service** is a deployable workload within a project.

## Deploy Types

**Repository** - Builds from a git repository using a Dockerfile.

**Image** - Pulls a pre-built Docker image.

## PORT Handling

Frost sets the `PORT` environment variable (default: 8080). Your app should listen on this port.

For images with hardcoded ports, set `container_port` in service settings to match.

## Inter-Service Communication

Services in the same project communicate using the service name as hostname:

```
http://api:8080/health
```
